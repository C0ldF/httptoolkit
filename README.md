<h1 align="center">HTTP Toolkit Pro Patcher</h1>

This is a simple tool to patch the HTTP Toolkit Pro app to enable the Pro features without a license or subscription. **But please consider supporting the developer by purchasing a license if you find the HTTP Toolkit useful.**

## Usage

1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/XielQs/httptoolkit-pro-patcher.git`
2. cd into the directory using `cd httptoolkit-pro-patcher`
3. Run `npm install` or whatever package manager you use
4. Run `node . patch` to patch the app

That's it! The app should now have the Pro features enabled.

***Tip**: You can also run `node . restore` to restore the original app.*

**Note**: This tool only works with the latest version of the app. If the app is updated, you will need to run the patcher again.

## Using with Proxy

If you want to add a proxy to the patcher, you can set the `PROXY` environment variable. For example, `PROXY=http://x.x.x.x:8080 node . patch` or `PROXY=http://x.x.x.x:8080 node . start`.

**Note**: The proxy must be an HTTPS/HTTP proxy. SOCKS proxies are not supported.
**Note**: `PROXY` is only used for the patcher. The app itself will not use the proxy.

## How it works

This tool simply creates a server *(at port 5067)* and acts as like a MITM proxy to intercept and download HTTP Toolkit app files ([app.httptoolkit.tech](https://app.httptoolkit.tech)) and patches the `main.js` file to enable the Pro features. For more information, see the [patch's source code](patch.js) or the [patcher](index.js) file.

***Tip**: You can also change the `PORT` environment variable to use a different port. For example, `PORT=8080 httptoolkit` or `PORT=8080 node . start`.*

**Note**: This tool does not modify the original app files. It only intercepts and modifies the files in memory (and saves the modified files to cache).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v15 or higher) (with npm 7 at least)

## Compatibility

- **Windows**: ✔
- **Linux**: ✔
- **macOS**: ✔

## Known Issues

- **Linux**: Try using `sudo` if you get permission errors
- If you get an error like `No internet connection and file is not cached`, it means the patcher is unable to connect to the internet. Make sure you have an active internet connection and try again. If you are using a proxy, make sure proxy is working well.
- If HTTP Toolkit does not start after patching, try updating your Node.js version to the latest version.
